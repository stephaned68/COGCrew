# COGCrew 

_A Roll20 MOD script for the Chroniques Oubli√©es Galactiques character sheet_

## Usage

This script allows the crew bonuses on a starship or mecha character sheet to be automatically updated with the player characters sheets attributes values.

For the script to work, you must set up your game as follow :
- The names of the characters in the crew stations fields must exactly match the names of character sheets
- On the starship or mecha sheet, in the Configuration tab, check the "Utiliser COGCrew" box

Whenever the ship or mecha sheet is opened, the script will update the crew bonuses with the attribute values of the player character sheets.
